# ASP.NET Core / WebAssembly Blazor Example Project

This example project is a simplified CMMS software (computerized maintenance management system) which is used to track equipment and parts. The example pregenerates a simple sortation conveyor system for a BHS (baggage handling system) and some common parts for conveyor. The example has two pages, assets and parts.

## Assets
The assets page allows the user to add/edit/delete assets. Assets can be arrange in a hierarchy manner and an asset either represents important equipment in the system, an area for inventory storage or a logical grouping for the children underneath it. Basic information can be entered about the asset and for equipment assets, the asset can taken offline or 
put back online. Also, the user can add/edit/delete storage locations for an area asset.

## Parts
The parts page allows the user to add/edit/delete parts used for maintenance purposes on the equipment assets the CMMS keeps track of. Basic information can be entered about the part. Also, the user can add/edit/delete part inventory associated with a storage location of an area asset.
